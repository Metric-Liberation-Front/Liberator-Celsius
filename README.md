## **"In Celsius We Trust, In Meters We Measure"** - The Liberator Celsius
--- 
Why should we suffered from `UNUNIFIED MEASUREMENTS`? 
This is a revolutionary React application dedicated to `the noble cause of liberating humanity` from the `ancient curse of imperial measurements`. 
Water freezes in **ZERO**, not 32; We expect you resolve for science, standardization.

## 🏴 THE REVOLUTION MANIFESTO
For too long, humanity has suffered under the oppressive reign of:

- `Fahrenheit` - Why did he mix ammonium chloride into water?
- `Feet`       - Hey, whose feet are them, anyway?
- `Pounds`     - Were it in the duodecimal scale at least, I could understand - 16 ounces in a pound
- `Gallons`    - Different in every country. They might think chaos is fun.

...🤔...🤔...🤔...🤔...
**NO MORE!**
 The time has come to unite under the banner of scientific reason!

## ⚖️ WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL
In fact, imperial units have commited some problems.
Imperial units are guilty of:

- Causing NASA spacecraft crashes
- Confusing chemistry students worldwide
- Making international trade unnecessarily complicated
- General crimes against mathematical logic

## ⚔️ WEAPONS OF MASS CONVERSION

### 🗡️ LIBERATE MODE
**"Seek and destroy imperial tyranny"**

The Nemesis is imperial units!
Convert them under scientific justice.
Fahrenheit will fall, Miles will burn, Gallons shoud be repacked.

### 👨‍🍳 COOK MODE
**"Liberate the kitchen from measurement chaos"**

Free your recipes from tablespoon tyranny
Convert cups to milliliters like a civilized human
Make your oven temperature actually make sense

### 😈 IMPERIAL MODE
**"Know thy enemy"**

Reverse conversion for intelligence gathering
Study imperial weaknesses
Understand the enemy's twisted logic (temporarily)

### 🌍 INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT
Our movement spans the globe! Available in 8+ languages because the metric revolution knows no borders:
🇯🇵 Japanese Front: "帝国軍の敵対勢力検出"
🇩🇪 German Division: "IMPERIALE ÜBERRESTE ENTDECKT"
🇫🇷 French Resistance: "VESTIGES IMPÉRIAUX DÉTECTÉS"
🇺🇸 American Liberation: "IMPERIAL NEMESIS DETECTED" (Yes, we're coming for you too, America)

### 🎯 RECRUITMENT EXAMPLES
Join the cause! Here are some common battles:

   • 80°F → 26.67 °C<br />
   • 30inch → 76.2 cm<br />
